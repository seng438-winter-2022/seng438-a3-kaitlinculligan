# 1 Introduction

In this lab, we use white-box testing on the SUT from assignment 2. We also utilize code-coverage tools to help us understand the strength of our previously written test suite. The code-coverage tools will help us understand coverage metrics such as statement, branch, and condition coverage. In addition, we will also do maunal analysis of data-flow coverage in the system.

# 2 Manual data-flow coverage calculations for X and Y methods

# 3 A detailed description of the testing strategy for the new unit test

Text…

# 4 A high level description of five selected test cases you have designed using coverage information, and how they have increased code coverage

Text…

# 5 A detailed report of the coverage achieved of each class and method (a screen shot from the code cover results in green and red color would suffice)

Text…

# 6 Pros and Cons of coverage tools used and Metrics you report

Text…

# 7 A comparison on the advantages and disadvantages of requirements-based test generation and coverage-based test generation.

Text…

# 8 A discussion on how the team work/effort was divided and managed

Text…

# 9 Any difficulties encountered, challenges overcome, and lessons learned from performing the lab
